# Documentation Sources for MQC3

Source files for the [MQC3 user documentation](source/index.md).

## Introduction

The user documentation is written in Markdown (`.md`) and Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) formats, with one section per file.

## Requirements

- Supported Platforms
  - Linux (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS recommended; WSL2 on Windows 11 is also supported)
  - Windows 11
  - macOS (Apple silicon, ARM64)
- Python: 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12

## Building the documentation

To generate the HTML files for the user documentation:

1. Change to the repository root:

   ```sh
   cd ..
   ```

2. Install SDK with local simulator and development tools:

   ```sh
   python -m pip install ".[sf,dev]"
   ```

3. Change into the docs directory:

   ```sh
   cd docs
   ```

4. Generate API stubs into `source/reference/`:

   ```sh
   sphinx-apidoc -e -M -f -o source/reference/ ../src/mqc3/
   ```

5. Set the environment variable:

   ```sh
   export MQC3_CLIENT_TOKEN="<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"
   ```

6. Generate the HTML files in `build/html`:

   ```sh
   make html
   ```
