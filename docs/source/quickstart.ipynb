    "## Three representations of quantum circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the example code, we first introduce the three different representations of quantum circuits in MQC3: **circuit representation**, **graph representation**, and **machinery representation**.\n",
    "To execute an optical quantum computing using MQC3, you need to create a machinery representation of the quantum circuit.\n",
    "If you start with a circuit representation, MQC3 will automatically convert it to a graph representation, and then further transform it into a machinery representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Representation           | Brief Description |\n",
    "| -----------------------  | ----------------- |\n",
    "| Circuit representation   | A standard continuos-variable quantum circuit consisting of modes and operations performed on modes. See [Constructing Circuit Representation](circuit_repr.ipynb) for details. |\n",
    "| Graph representation     | An intermediate representation between the circuit representation and the machinery representation. See [Constructing Graph Representation](graph_repr.ipynb) for details. |\n",

    "### Example: Circuit Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below shows an example of a circuit representation.\n",
    "This circuit consists of two modes, mode `0` and mode `1`, and performs five operations in sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rotate mode `0` by $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$\n",
    "2. Displace the $x$-quadrature of mode `0` by $1$ and the $p$-quadrature by $-1$\n",
    "3. Perform a controlled-Z operation between mode `0` and mode `1`\n",
    "4. Measure mode `0` at a measurement angle of $0$\n",
    "5. Measure mode `1` at a measurement angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "See [Gates](gates.md) for the definition of these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![circuit](_images/circuit_repr_sample_circuit.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Graph Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below illustrates the graph representation corresponding to the above circuit representation.\n",
    "The graph representation can be visualized in two dimensions, as shown below.\n",
    "The twelve large circles are called **macronodes**, and each macronode contains four small circles, which are called **micronodes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A \"step\" consists of a group of vertically aligned macronodes.\n",
    "* The number of macronodes arranged vertically is the number of local macronodes per step.\n",
    "* The number of macronodes arranged horizontally is the number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The number of local macronodes per step is `3`.\n",
    "* The number of steps is `4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The blue micronode represents mode `0`, which undergoes transformations as it passes through four macronodes.\n",
    "The red micronode corresponds to mode `1`, which is processed through three macronodes.\n",
    "Both modes are initialized at the first macronode and measured at the last macronode.\n",
    "Thus, this graph representation is equivalent to the circuit representation shown above.\n",
